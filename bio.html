<p><strong>Hi there!</strong> I’m an incoming Assistant Professor, joining <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell CS</a> in fall 2025. Until then, I’m working as a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.theaiinstitute.com">The AI Institute</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I want to make robots move like humans.</strong> My work integrates <em>machine learning</em>, <em>computer vision</em>, and <em>control theory</em> to imbue robots with surprising agility and robustness for contact-rich tasks like manipulation and locomotion. This approach balances theoretical foundations with practical algorithms to build robots with human-level dexterity and flexibility in the real world.</p>

<p><strong>Prospective students:</strong> I’m looking for motivated students to join my lab! If you have a strong background in robotics or machine learning, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions">please apply</a> to the Cornell CS PhD program and mention my name in your application.</p>
