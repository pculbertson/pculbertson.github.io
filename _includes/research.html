<h3> Research </h3>

I want to build <b>collaborative</b> robots that can <b>understand and interact</b> with their environment, humans, and other robots. <br><br>

My primary research interests are <b>adaptive</b>
and <b>learning-based control</b>, <b>manipulation and grasping</b>, and <b>multi-agent interaction
and coordination</b> (especially without communication). <br><br>
