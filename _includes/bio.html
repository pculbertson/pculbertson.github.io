<p> I'm a postdoc at <a href="https://caltech.edu">Caltech</a>, working in the <a href="http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/">AMBER Lab</a> with Prof. <a href="http://ames.caltech.edu/">Aaron Ames</a>. Before Caltech, I completed my PhD at <a href="https://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/">Mac Schwager</a>.

<p> During my PhD, I also had the pleasure to spend my summers with the <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/groups/MaritimeandMultiAgent/">multi-robot group</a> at <a href="https://jpl.nasa.gov/">JPL.</a></p> Outside of research, I love to bake, rock climb, and wrangle my grey tabby, Huxley.</p>
