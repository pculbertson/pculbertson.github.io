<p> I'm a PhD candidate at <a href="https://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>, working in the <a href="https://msl.stanford.edu">Multi-Robot Systems Lab</a> with Prof. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/">Mac Schwager</a>, and supported by the NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/strg/nstgro/">NSTGRO</a>. I also had the pleasure to spend my summers with the <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/groups/MaritimeandMultiAgent/">multi-robot group</a> at <a href="https://jpl.nasa.gov/">JPL.</a><b> I am currently on the academic job market!</b></p>

<p> Before Stanford, I graduated from <a href="https://gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a> in 2016, where I led the <a href="https://solarracing.gatech.edu">solar car team</a> and worked on multi-quadrotor lifting. Outside of research, I love to bake, read sci-fi, and wrangle my two cats, Harper and Huxley.</p>
