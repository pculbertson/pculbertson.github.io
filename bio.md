**Hi there!** I'm an incoming Assistant Professor, joining [Cornell CS](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) in fall 2025. Until then, I'm working as a Research Scientist at [The AI Institute](https://www.theaiinstitute.com).

**I want to make robots move like humans.** I want to make robots move like humans. My work integrates *machine learning*, *computer vision*, and *control theory* to imbue robots with surprising agility and robustness for contact-rich tasks like manipulation and locomotion. This approach balances theoretical foundations with practical algorithms to build robots with human-level dexterity and flexibility in the real world.
    
**Prospective students:** I'm looking for motivated students to join my lab! If you have a strong background in robotics or machine learning, [please apply](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions) to the Cornell CS PhD program and mention my name in your application.
